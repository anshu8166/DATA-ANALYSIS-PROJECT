## 🚕 Uber Multi-Service Operations Dashboard

### 📊 Project Overview

This project presents an **interactive Uber Operations Dashboard** built using detailed ride-sharing data. The dashboard performs a comparative analysis of key services (*Auto, Bike, Go Mini, Go Sedan, Premier Sedan, Uber XL*) and provides critical insights into:

* **Total Revenue & Bookings** 💰 per vehicle type.
* **Service Status** ✔️ (Completed, Cancelled, Incomplete rides).
* **Operational Friction:** Breakdown of **Cancellations by Driver vs. Customer** 🛑.
* **Geographical Hotspots** 📍: Top Pickup and Dropoff locations.
* **Temporal Trends:** Revenue and booking performance by **Year/Month**.
* **Service Quality:** Average Customer and Driver Ratings ⭐.

The purpose of this dashboard is to analyze the operational efficiency and profitability of each service, providing data-driven insights to optimize resource allocation and improve customer experience.

### ⭐ How to Use

1.  Open the **Dashboard File** link above.
2.  Use the **vehicle type selection** buttons to filter the data for specific services like 'Uber XL' or 'Auto'.
3.  Utilize the **Month/Quarter slicers** to explore time-based trends in revenue and bookings.
4.  Focus on the **Cancellation charts** to identify the most significant points of operational failure.
5.  Watch the demo video for a guided tour of the dashboard's features.

### 🚀 Future Improvements

* **Geographical Mapping** 🗺️: Integrate actual map visuals to show trip density and average distance by region.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Develop a model to predict peak demand hours or cancellation likelihood.
* **Cost Analysis:** Integrate driver payout data to calculate net profitability per ride type.
